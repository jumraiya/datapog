# datapog

My toy datalog engine, mainly for learning purposes

# Goals
- Allow execution of datalog programs with recursion and negation

- Rules follow traditional datalog syntax (no triple stores)

- Use fixed point semantics and semi-naive evaluation

- Implement pushdown automata for chain queries, magic sets rewriting
